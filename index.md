# Introduction to Terraform
Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc. Terraform can manage both existing service providers and custom in-house solutions.

## Key Features
Infrastructure as Code
You describe your infrastructure using Terraform's high-level configuration language in human-readable, declarative configuration files. This allows you to create a blueprint that you can version, share, and reuse.

## Execution Plans
Terraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do and asks for your approval before making any infrastructure changes. This allows you to review changes before Terraform creates, updates, or destroys infrastructure.

## Resource Graph
Terraform builds a resource graph and creates or modifies non-dependent resources in parallel. This allows Terraform to build resources as efficiently as possible and gives you greater insight into your infrastructure.

## Change Automation
Terraform can apply complex changesets to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. When you update configuration files, Terraform determines what changed and creates incremental execution plans that respect dependencies.

Write configuration
The set of files used to describe infrastructure in Terraform is known as a Terraform configuration. You will write your first configuration to define a single AWS EC2 instance.

Each Terraform configuration must be in its own working directory. Create a directory for your configuration.

$ mkdir learn-terraform-aws-instance
Copy
Change into the directory.

$ cd learn-terraform-aws-instance
Copy
Create a file to define your infrastructure.

$ touch main.tf
Copy
Open main.tf in your text editor, paste in the configuration below, and save the file.

Tip: The AMI ID used in this configuration is specific to the us-west-2 region. If you would like to use a different region, see the Troubleshooting section for guidance.

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.27"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 0.14.9"
}

provider "aws" {
  profile = "default"
  region  = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-830c94e3"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleAppServerInstance"
  }
}
Copy
This is a complete configuration that you can deploy with Terraform. The following sections review each block of this configuration in more detail.

Â»Terraform Block
The terraform {} block contains Terraform settings, including the required providers Terraform will use to provision your infrastructure. For each provider, the source attribute defines an optional hostname, a namespace, and the provider type. Terraform installs providers from the Terraform Registry by default. In this example configuration, the aws provider's source is defined as hashicorp/aws, which is shorthand for registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws.

You can also set a version constraint for each provider defined in the required_providers block. The version attribute is optional, but we recommend using it to constrain the provider version so that Terraform does not install a version of the provider that does not work with your configuration. If you do not specify a provider version, Terraform will automatically download the most recent version during initialization.

To learn more, reference the provider source documentation.
